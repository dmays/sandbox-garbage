# sandbox-garbage

A place for some garbage I need. This probably isn't useful to anyone except me. Let me know if I'm wrong about that, though.

Some text and binary garbage files will be commited to create a test case for git repo management.  The test will be conducted and the repo history will be rewritten and the results observed.
